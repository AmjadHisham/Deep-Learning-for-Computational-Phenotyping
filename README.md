## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Model for Patient Representation Learning to Uncover Temporal Phenotypes for Heart Failure
Electronic Health Records (EHR) are immense datasets filled with a wealth of all kinds of medical data for each patient for each medical visit. However, traditional methods of data analysis on EHR datasets prove impenetrable due to its size, dimensionality, and irregularity. Heart failure (HF) has frustrated caregivers due to its nature as an overarching condition rather than a distinct phenotype. For instance, there are two proposed broad phenotypes of HF based on reduced or preserved ejection fraction; while one phenotype is quite treatable, the other phenotype is difficult to treat. In this work, we propose to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) on EHR data pre-processed by Word2Vec, which would allow us to efficiently extract informative representations of HF patients. The representation can help identify a new set of phenotypes with similar EHR profiles to facilitate treatment of patients with HF.
